# DealflowAnalysis

Every year at Ventech, we receive more than 1,500 opportunities to invest in tech startups all over Europe. Since 1998, we had therefore the chance to come across exciting topics from optical fiber and semiconductors (well, you probably do not find it that exciting anymore today!) to bitcoin or virtual reality. Still today, we are impressed by the speed with which markets and technologies are changing. It is still surprising to receive several opportunities with almost exactly the same product and business model during the same week!

Drawing on this, we decided to take the most of this considerable amount of data carefully gathered about each new deal opportunity in order to provide you with some “homemade” insights. What are the next big trends ? How fast are new technologies evolving ? Who are the role models / competitors startup are comparing themselves to ?
